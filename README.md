# redux-architecture-challenge

This repo is my solution for [the scalable frontend architecture challenge](https://github.com/slorber/scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux).

[Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)

My principle:
1. immutable data
2. pure function
3. high order function

IMO, Apply these basis functional programming technique, we don't need any extra concept.
